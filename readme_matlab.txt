These MatLab functions are usefull to plot some results about the damages in a building.
To be sure all this stuff work good :

- compute3D_damages_NLA.m should be in the "NLTH_results" directory
- compute3D_damages_PO.m should be in the "op_model_" directory (just before the "NLTH_results" one)
- damages_scatter_density.m should be in the "NLTH_results" directory, this code needs densityScatter.m and scatplot.m to work well.
